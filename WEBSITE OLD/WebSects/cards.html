                            <p>The Mapping Journey Project comes out of the artist’s long-term exploration of what she has called the “gestures and discourses of resistance as elaborated and delivered by members of political minorities.” This immersive video installation chronicles the stories of eight individuals who have been forced by political and economic conditions to travel illegally, and whose covert journeys have taken them throughout the Mediterranean Basin. Khalili met each of her subjects by chance before inviting them to participate in this work. The videos depict the hands of each participant, their faces unseen, as they map their trajectories in permanent marker and narrate their journeys—in some cases many years long or interrupted by periods of detainment. With this work, Khalili takes on the challenge of developing critical and ethical approaches to questions of citizenship, community, and political agency. </p>

                            <p>For Afloat, Sikander returned to screenprinting, creating a bold, ethereal work inspired by her installations of painting murals layered with translucent drawings. She incorporates her recurring motifs, including a headless female figure with trailing tendrils and a smaller female figure in profile. The ornamental dot patterns relate to geometric shapes, in particular the circle, with its spiritual significance of unity and infinity. Although Afloat appears to comprise multiple overlapping sheets of paper, it is actually printed on both sides of one sheet of semi-transparent Thai Mulberry paper, using gradations of color that achieve the look of layered translucency. “Identity is not a given, but a fluid process that unfolds over time,” Sikander has said, a reflection that addresses the themes of her work, but also applies to the process of printmaking.</p>

By using a diversity of styles and digitally printed elements, Mutu reimagines female archetypes that range from ancient goddess figures to realistic female anatomy and otherworldly science fictional cyborgs</p>
