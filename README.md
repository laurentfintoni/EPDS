Rhizome's dataset (AKA the ArtBase) via their [SPARQL endpoint](https://query.artbase.rhizome.org/). We would like to acknowledge and thank Dragan Espenschied, Preservation Director at Rhizome, for his willingness to answer some of our questions about the formatting of Rhizome's data and supplying us with a copy of the RDF dump.
